Hi there 👋 my name is Caleb Hailey. 
I live in Portland, Oregon 🌲 and I have had the great fortune of getting paid to play with computers for the last 15+ years. 👨🏽‍💻 
I owned my first computer in 2002, got my first tech job in 2006, launched my first tech product in 2011, and became the co-founder and CEO of my first tech startup in 2017 (@sensu), which was subsequently acquired in 2021 (by [Sumo Logic](https://sumologic.com)). 🤯 

I :heart: open source software. 

My career in technology started with relational database application support, followed by various project management, customer success, and sales engineering roles before I eventually discovered my true passion: product management. 
I'm the happiest when I'm building something and shipping it. 
Developing and delivering products that then become _platforms_ has led me to my secondary passion in tech: developer advocacy. 
I love participating in open source communities and helping people solve interesting problems. 

I'm currently taking a semi-sabbatical and contemplating my next startup.
